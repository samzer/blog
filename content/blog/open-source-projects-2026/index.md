Its a new year and I want to challenge myself to ship an Open Source project per week. I would like this project to be useful for me 
as well as anyone else who would like to use it. 

My motivation to do this is to 
- Challenge myself
- Get my creative juices flowing
- Make use of AI tools and apply them practically

The last one is particulary interesting for me because I've been implementing LLM's in my organization for the past 2 years and we have generated lot of business value from it. I want to push this even further now because the whole AI landscape is fast moving and it is fun. Doing these projects will also give me ideas on how to apply some of these tools in a new way in my organization and drive more business value.

In the process of satisfying my personal itch, if any of the project helps some with their problem then that would be an added bonus.
