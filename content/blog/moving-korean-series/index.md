description: As a fan of Korean movies who hadn't explored Korean series before, I was intrigued by Raunaq's recommendation of "Moving," a 20-episode series that, after a slow start, captivated me with its mix of superpowers, politics, espionage, and emotional depth, making it a standout in a sea of content and truly immersing me in its fictional world.

I'm an ardent admirer of Korean cinema, having thoroughly enjoyed remarkable films like "The Spy Gone North", "Burning", "A Taxi Driver" and "Going by the Book". Surprisingly, I haven't delved into Korean series until recently. Several recommendations came my way, but for various reasons, I hadn't explored any of them.

Then, by chance, I came across Raunaq's video discussing a Korean series called ["Moving"](https://www.youtube.com/@RaunaqMangottill). This 20-episode series, significantly longer than most series on OTT platforms, piqued my curiosity due to Raunaq's insightful commentary, prompting me to give it a shot.

 **"Moving"**

While the initial episodes were engaging, it was around the fifth episode that "Moving" truly began to captivate me. I had some inkling of what to expect, but what unfolded surpassed my expectations, holding me spellbound until the very end.

In the realm of entertainment, Marvel's post-"Avengers: Endgame" offerings have often felt lackluster, akin to biting into a cardboard burger. However, exceptions like "Loki" stand out. The "Boyz" series, with its subversive and shocking elements, is commendable but lacks enduring memorability.

"Moving" seamlessly weaves superpowers, political intrigue, espionage, and everyday life into its narrative, all underpinned by a robust emotional core. Much like memorable works such as "Terminator 2," "Interstellar," and "Game of Thrones," "Moving" thrives on the strength of its emotional connections.

The series excels in character development, skillfully subverting expectations by transforming certain characters from presumed protagonists to supporting players. Even antagonists garner empathy. Complex character traits emerge, such as an invulnerable character's emotional vulnerability, a meticulous character's hasty judgment, and a meek character's transformation into a formidable force.

The production quality of "Moving" is nothing short of astounding, rivaling that of a cinematic experience. Every fight scene and visual effect lingers in memory, setting it apart in a crowded content landscape.

The mark of a good movie or series for me is one that makes you forget your real life and gets you invested in the fictional life.
