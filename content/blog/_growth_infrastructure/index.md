# How to build your growth infrastructure?

This article is more for me to record my learnings on how to build to an effective growth infrastructure. This topic specially interests me because a lot of organizations struggle in building an effective growth infrastructure that give them answers on what is working and what is not working. 

Its not easy to find an effective Revenue Operations person and also the Marketing Organization and Sales Organization can have their respective operation person who work in their respective silos and not fully understand how the systems of the two organization can talk to each other.

If its a Tech company then there is the product/platform which also needs to speak to these systems by sharing data.

My intention with this article is to crystalise my learnings and also help anyone who is reading this to build an effective growth infrastructure.
